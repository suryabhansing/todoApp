This is a new [**TodoApp**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone code from repo

First clone code using command `git clone https://github.com/suryabhansing/todoApp.git`

## Step 2: Installation of node module

You need to go in project directory then run command " npm i "

npm run android
   or
npx react-native run-android
